Complete re-design of my Code Louisville Project

I'm redesigning the website I built for my Code Louisville Project using new techniques I've learned along the way. 

I built this site as a requirement for the CodeLouisville Front End Web Development class. As an added benefit, the site will also serve as the base for a good friend's new woodworking business.

You can check out the site by downloading the project folder and launching index.html or by visiting emmawoodshop.com
