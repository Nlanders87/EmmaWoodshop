Complete re-design of my Code Louisville Project

I'm redesigning the website I built for my Code Louisville Project using new techniques I've learned along the way. 

I built this site as a requirement for the CodeLouisville Front End Web Development class. As an added benefit, the site will also serve as the base for a good friend's new woodworking business.

There are plans for the site to go live in the future. In the meantime, you can launch the site by downloading the project files and opening the index.html.
